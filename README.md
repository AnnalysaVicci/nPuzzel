# nPuzzel
 nPuzzle Program
 
 Takes a board of pieces 1-8 with 1 blank tile then solves the puzzle so the pieces ended up in numerical order.
 Implements breadth-first, depth-first, iterative deepening and A* search algorithms. 
 Utilizes the Manhattan Distance and Number of Misplaced Tile heuristics for more effective searches.
 
 # Known Issues
 I have yet to configure the code for a 16-Puzzle
 Incorrect output when printing the optimal path for each search
 
 # Lessons Learned
 This was my first time using a profiler to get an understanding of my programs space and time complexity.
